PBEopt: performance-based optimization with python.

This is a python code used to perform the risk optimization of the columns of a reinforced concrete building using statistical linearization.
The building is modeled as a nonlinear multi-degree-of-freedom oscillator.
The wind excitation is modeled as a stochastic process.

The current version is a pre-release; therefore, users must consider the inherent risks of using a package under development.
